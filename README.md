Instagram is a photo and video sharing social networking app that allows
users to upload media, and be organized by hashtags. Users can browse
other users' content by tags and locations, view trending content, like
photos, and follow other users to add their content to a personal feed.
I implemented features like user flow and management, personal feed,
stories, likes, commenting, sharing and Hashtags which are the core
features of any social networking application.
Developed the backend of the application that mapped to most of the
functionalities using Golang and PostgreSQL.
